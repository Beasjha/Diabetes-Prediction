# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical features. It uses libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data processing and model building.
The project applies machine learning techniques to predict diabetes based on medical attributes. It involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training (likely using SVM-Support Vector Machine), and evaluation to determine how well the model can classify diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
